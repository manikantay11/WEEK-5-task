Superstore-Sales-Analysis
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset from a global superstore spanning four years. 
The objective is to gain insights into sales trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. 
Through thorough analysis, we aim to uncover valuable information that can inform business decisions and potentially support predictive modeling efforts. 
The analysis will include both univariate and bivariate approaches, covering various aspects such as understanding the dataset structure, data cleaning, descriptive statistics, visualization of distributions, time series analysis, correlation exploration, and much more.
By following these steps, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Superstore sales dataset, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
